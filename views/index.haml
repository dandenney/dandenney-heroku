      I 
      <span data-icon="&#x0028;" aria-hidden="true"></span> 
      the web 
      %div 
        and the people that build it.

    %h2 A little about me:

    %h3 
      %span 
        I work with the awesome team at 
        %a(href="http://envylabs.com") Envy Labs
        , doing front-end work for projects including 
        %a(href="http://codeschool.com")Code School.
      %span
        Because I'm (probably a little too) social, I 
        %a(href="http://twitter.com/dandenney") tweet a lot
        , attend as many meetups and conferences as possible, 
        %a(href="/posts")share my thoughts via posts
        and even run a 
        %a(href="http://frontendconf.com")front-end conf
        with the help of my awesome wife, Cherrie.

    %p There's more to the story: I'm a husband, dad, traveler, music lover and a foodie but most of my sharing on here is about the interwebs.
