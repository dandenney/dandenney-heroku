  %h1 I would love to have you on the stage at Front-End Conf&nbsp;'13.

  %p We have talked about this a little bit already, but I wanted to try to answer any questions that you may immediately have.

  %section

    %h2 
      %strike What, Where and 
      When is it?
    %p 
      %strike
        It's a two-day event focused on front-end design and dev held in St. Petersburg, Florida. 
      It will be on June 21st and 22nd in 2013.

    %h2 Why Me?
    %p You are Mr. Front-End Conf! Your 'ooooh laptop' dedication and your awesome way of giving back to the community are things that I want to ingrain into every attendee.
    %p Aside from my fanboy gushings, you have this knack for always being relevant. The only blog that I consistently read now that I did when I first got into the industry is CSS-Tricks. On top of that, you have brought us Codepen and your most recent sharings have been inline with my one little app idea. Basically, you rock.
    %p Providing that he still wants to do it, I would also love to add in a Shop-Talk Show section with you and Dave. This would be in addition to the 7 speakers and I was thinking that we could field questions in advance.

    %h2 What Do You Want From Me?
    %p I would love to have you on stage to give a presentation, which has a 50 minute window for the talk and Q&A. The topic is up to you because I feel it is important for you to choose what you are eager to share. Of course I'll provide more info about the usual crowd if you are interested in speaking. 

    %p I know that you'll be working on the actual presentation until minutes before you're on the stage, but I would love to have all of the topics by the end of December. I haven't been the best about getting topics out to the crowd in a timely fashion in the past, so I would really like to launch the site with them this year.

    %h2 What about Compensation?
    %p We provide travel, lodging and fun. Our goal is for it to not cost you money to come down and present, but we don't offer actual payment. We try to keep the attendee cost as low as possible for those people not lucky enough to have company conference budgets. 
    %p We will arrange travel and lodging or provide compensation for it if you'd like to arrange it. Typically, past speakers have flown in Thursday and out on Saturday or Sunday depending on if they wanted to attend day 2.
    %p There is a speaker dinner the night before the event and we will arrange for lunch and dinner if you're around for those on the day of. (Many people end up out with groups.)

    %h2 What's Next?
    %p 
      Once you've checked your calendar and given it some thought, please just shoot me an email (
      %a(href="mailto:dan@dandenney.com")dan@dandenney.com
      ) or a DM to let me know if you'll be making my day! Then we can work out the details.

    %p 
      %em Thank you!
